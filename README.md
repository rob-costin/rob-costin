As  FileMaker Pro developer I've helped a lot businesses grow. I've learned that every business is unique. When I talk to owners and managers, I know there's more to understand than just a category of product or service - whether you produce cakes or cabinets or conventions - I try to understand the unique approach you take within your environment, with your people, and with the resources that distinguish your business from others.

I can offer you custom apps to support your unique way of working: labor saving automations, insightful views showing how your smallest details affect your big picture.

Custom apps include familiar components like inventory, billing, customer relations, scheduling, task management, reporting, communications, or a combination.

But I make sure yours rest on a foundation you probably won't get from off-the-shelf software: a correct representation of the things, people, and events you work with: a true custom database. Then I make sure you have logic that correctly represents how you work - how you move materials, connect people, transform resources, add value.

Finally, I assemble the strongest available technologies and techniques into apps that give you the ease and efficiency you need. Apps that provide clarity. Apps to empower.
